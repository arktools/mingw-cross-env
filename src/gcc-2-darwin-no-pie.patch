mingw-cross-env specific workaround for OSX Lion's new ASLR
causing problems with pre-compiled headers.

1. more recent native compilers don't solve the problem
2. there isn't an equivalent sysctl for "kernel.randomize_va_space"
3. there isn't an equivalent command for "setarch -R"
4. Apple's version of gcc (based on 4.2) uses custom Makefiles that set "-fno-pic"

Patch below achieves a similar result to 4, without drifting
too far from standard gcc.
